Drivers are a fundamental part of printer installation. A driver is essentially a translator between your printer and your computer or mobile device. Without the right driver, your system may not recognize the printer at all or may only offer limited, generic functions. Therefore, understanding how to properly download the Canon PRINT Inkjet/SELPHY driver is crucial for anyone using Canon’s inkjet or compact photo printers.

Canon PRINT Inkjet/SELPHY System Guide
======================================

Understanding the Canon PRINT Inkjet/SELPHY System
--------------------------------------------------

The **Canon PRINT Inkjet/SELPHY** application is designed to work with a wide range of Canon printers, including:

- Inkjet printers (e.g., PIXMA, MAXIFY)
- SELPHY photo printers

Inkjet printers handle everyday printing, scanning, and copying tasks, while SELPHY printers are compact, portable photo printers that use dye-sublimation technology for high-quality, smudge-free photo outputs.

The Canon PRINT app enables users to:

- Wirelessly send print jobs
- Scan documents
- Monitor printer status
- Manage settings from mobile devices

.. important::

   For desktop or laptop communication with a printer—especially over a wireless or USB connection—a proper **printer driver** is required.

The driver ensures your computer can interpret and manage:

- Borderless, high-resolution photo printing
- Paper size and media type handling
- Duplex (double-sided) printing
- Ink level reporting and printer status

While the Canon PRINT app facilitates mobile connectivity, the **printer driver** provides system-level integration.

The Importance of Installing the Correct Driver
-----------------------------------------------

Each Canon printer model and operating system requires a **specific driver**. A driver that works with one printer or OS may not function with another, even if the printers belong to the same product line.

Installing the correct driver ensures:

- Full access to printer features
- High-resolution and color-accurate prints
- Paper type and layout compatibility
- Firmware update support
- Stable wireless or USB communication

.. warning::

   Using the wrong or outdated driver may lead to:
   - Connection failures
   - Limited or missing functionality
   - Print errors or poor output quality

For desktop and laptop users—especially when connecting via USB or setting up wireless printing—the driver is critical for proper operation, even if the mobile app is in use.

Identifying Your Canon Printer Model
------------------------------------

Before downloading a driver, identify your printer model. Canon produces a wide array of printers across these major lines:

- **PIXMA** (home/office inkjet)
- **MAXIFY** (small business inkjet)
- **SELPHY** (photo printers)

The model number is typically located:

- Near the control panel or LCD screen
- On the back or underside of the printer
- Within the printer’s internal settings or displayed on the screen

.. note::

   Drivers are model-specific. For instance, the Canon PIXMA MG3620 driver is **not** compatible with the PIXMA TS9120 or SELPHY CP1300.

Determining Your Operating System
---------------------------------

Canon provides different drivers for:

- **Windows** (10, 11, etc.)
- **macOS** (Ventura, Monterey, Big Sur, etc.)
- **Linux** (limited support for some models)

On Windows, determine whether your system is **32-bit** or **64-bit**. On macOS, identify the exact version from the **About This Mac** section.

.. caution::

   Installing a driver for the wrong OS version may prevent your printer from being detected or cause malfunction.

Locating the Correct Driver for Your Canon Printer

- The printer model
